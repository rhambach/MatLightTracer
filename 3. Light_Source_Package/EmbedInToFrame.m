    % Here the order for Top and Bottom is exchanged from the normal
    % expected order. This is because Matlab plots the indices are counted
    % from left to right and top to bottom. But normally we expect the
    % indices to increase from bottom to top !! 
    % To see what i mean run the following script
    %     pcolor(hadamard(20))
    %     colormap(gray(2))
    %     axis ij
    %     axis square

        zeros(zeroPixelsTop,size(U_xyTot,2))];
